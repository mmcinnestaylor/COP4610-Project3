### Division of Labor

Due to the nature of this assignment much of the labor was completed in person with all members 
present for the first portions of the project. In order to learn and gain practice we met frequently 
and bouced ideas off of each other while trying our own approaches and meeting back to land on what 
we considered to be the best take.

In each group meeting we all mapped out what we wanted to do and discussed how we wanted to divide 
everything up. We all got to know each others machines and we worked together to get things 
implemented. Due to our schedules, we realized after the break we would not have enough time to 
fully implement everything, and so we decided the best approach would be for us to meet every day
and do our best to get as much done together as a team as possible.

All members rate all other members a 10/10 would group again.
